# About
I am a PhD student in [Systems Biology Ireland](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/) as part of the [Centre for Research Training (CRT) Genomics Data Science](https://genomicsdatascience.ie/) programme, co-funded by the European Commissionâ€™s Marie Sklodowska Curie Actions (MSCA) COFUND programme. 

My work involves finding molecular vulnerabilities in high-risk pediatric leukemia through biological network analysis. I am interested in exploiting omics data to better understand childhood leukemia to aid in the development of better treatments. 

I am currently part of the [Bond](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/team/groups/bondgroup/) and [Ryan](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/team/groups/ryangroup/) groups in [SBI, UCD](https://www.ucd.ie/sbi/).
