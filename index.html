											<h2>What is ACORN?</h2>
										</header>
										<p style="text-align:justify">The outlook for children with cancer has improved enormously over the past few decades, 
											but there is still lots of room for improvement. Most cancer treatments for young people 
											come directly from the adult setting and include intensive chemotherapy that don’t work 
											for everybody, and which can cause severe and damaging long-term side-effects in children
											and adolescents. We believe that children across the island of Ireland deserve better.<p>
										<p style="text-align:justify">We have assembled the All-Ireland Children’s Oncology Research Network (ACORN), 
											a cross-border team of interdisciplinary scientists with the specific skills and expertise
											to tackle this problem. Initially established by researchers at University College Dublin 
											and Ulster University, the network is open to all scientists and health professionals working
											in childhood cancer research in Ireland and Northern Ireland.<p>
										<p style="text-align:justify">We have a particular focus on using computational and data science methods to analyse high-risk 
											paediatric blood and nerve cancers that have limited treatment options at the moment. 
											By using these precision medicine approaches, we want to find and develop more precise 
											treatments that work better and have fewer side-effects in children and adolescents. <p>
										<p style="text-align:justify">Long term, we are committed to translating this research to patient benefit as quickly as possible. 
											As ACORN is rooted in the clinic north and south of the border, we will directly engage with 
											young people and families affected by childhood cancers to place them at the centre of our 
											research efforts. These clinical links also means that promising findings can be rapidly moved
											into the clinic to benefit patients, providing important and meaningful effects on the lives of
											children with cancer across the island.</p>
